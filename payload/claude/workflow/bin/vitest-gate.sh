# Run vitest and map its result onto pytest's exit codes, so verify-red.sh can tell a genuine
# test failure (red) from a suite that never ran (not red). vitest exits 1 for both cases;
# the whole red gate depends on telling them apart.
#
# A worked example for /setup-workflow's stack step: a project on vitest can use this as-is;
# a project on another runner that doesn't split "failed" from "didn't run" across exit codes
# (jest, go test, cargo test, …) should copy this file and adapt the two `grep` patterns below
# to that runner's own wording for "no tests found" and "failed to load a file".
#
#   vitest-gate.sh [<vitest args...>]
#   vitest-gate.sh src/domain/prefill.test.ts src/domain/dial.test.ts
#
# Exit 0: tests ran, all passed.
# Exit 1: tests ran, at least one failed and nothing failed to load  -> a real red.
# Exit 2: no test files matched, a suite failed to import, or vitest itself errored.
#
# Set VITEST to override the runner (used by this repo's own tests of this script).
